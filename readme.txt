This plugin allows post types other than "page" to be displayed as the static front page.

== Description ==

Choose the post types that you would like to choose from in addition to Pages. The
"Front Page:" dropdown will then display each different post type in their own groups.

This will not result in a redirect on the front page as has been seen in other attempts
to provide this functionality. In addition, the canonical url will be properly reflected
as the home url.

== Installation ==

= From your WordPress dashboard =

1. Visit 'Plugins > Add New'
2. Search for 'CPT on Front Page'
3. Activate CTP on Front Page from your Plugins page.
