This plugin allows post types other than "page" to be displayed as the static front page.

== Description ==

Choose the post types that you would like to choose from in addition to Pages. The
"Front Page:" dropdown will then display each different post type in their own groups.

This will not result in a redirect on the front page as has been seen in other attempts
to provide this functionality. In addition, the canonical url will be properly reflected
as the home url.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place `<?php do_action('plugin_name_hook'); ?>` in your templates
